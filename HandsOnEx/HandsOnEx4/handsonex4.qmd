# 1. Visual Statistical Analysis

In this hands-on exercise, we will gain hands-on experience on using:

-   ggstatsplot package to create visual graphics with rich statistical information,

-   performance package to visualise model diagnostics, and

-   parameters package to visualise model parameters

## 1.1 Using ggstatsplot

**ggstatsplot** is an extension of [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package for creating graphics with details from statistical tests included in the information-rich plots themselves.

-   To provide alternative statistical inference methods by default

-   To follow best practices for statistical reporting. For all statistical tests reported in the plots, the default template abides by the \[APA\](https://my.ilstu.edu/\~jhkahn/apastats.html) gold standard for statistical reporting. For example, here are results from a robust t-test:

## 1.2 Getting Started

### 1.2.1 Installing the Required Packages

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggstatsplot, tidyverse)
```

### 1.2.2 Using the Exam Data

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")

head(exam_data)
```

## 1.3 One-sample Test: gghistostats() method

[*gghistostats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/gghistostats.html) is used to to build an visual of one-sample test on English scores.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

gghistostats(
  data = exam_data,
  x = ENGLISH,
  type = "bayes",
  test.value = 60,
  xlab = "English scores"
)
```

Default information: - statistical details - Bayes Factor - sample sizes - distribution summary

## 1.4 Unpacking the Bayes Factor

-   A Bayes factor is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.

-   That’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.

-   When we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as

![](images/clipboard-3788699597.png){fig-align="center" width="303" height="53"}

-   The [**Schwarz criterion**](https://www.statisticshowto.com/bayesian-information-criterion/) is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.

## 1.5 **How to interpret Bayes Factor**

A **Bayes Factor** can be any positive number. One of the most common interpretations is this one—first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by [Lee and Wagenmakers](https://www-tandfonline-com.libproxy.smu.edu.sg/doi/pdf/10.1080/00031305.1999.10474443?needAccess=true) in 2013:

## 1.6 Two-sample mean test: ggbetweenstats()

 [*ggbetweenstats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbetweenstats.html) is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender.

```{r}
ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam_data,
  x = GENDER, 
  y = MATHS,
  type = "np",
  messages = FALSE
)
```

Default information: - statistical details - Bayes Factor - sample sizes - distribution summary

## 1.7 One way ANOVA Test: ggbetweenstats() method

[*ggbetweenstats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbetweenstats.html) is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English score by race.

```{r}

ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam_data,
  x = RACE, 
  y = ENGLISH,
  type = "p",
  mean.ci = TRUE, 
  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, 
  pairwise.display = "s",
  p.adjust.method = "fdr",
  messages = FALSE
)

```

**pairwise.display**

:   Decides *which* pairwise comparisons to display. Available options are:

    -   `"significant"` (abbreviation accepted: `"s"`)

    -   `"non-significant"` (abbreviation accepted: `"ns"`)

    -   `"all"`

    You can use this argument to make sure that your plot is not uber-cluttered when you have multiple groups being compared and scores of pairwise comparisons being displayed. If set to `"none"`, no pairwise comparisons will be displayed.

## 1.8 Significant Test of Correlation: ggscatterstats () method

[*ggscatterstats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggscatterstats.html) is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Correlation between Maths scores and English scores.

```{r}
ggscatterstats(
  data = exam_data,
  x = MATHS,
  y = ENGLISH,
  marginal = FALSE,
  )
```

## 1.9 **Significant Test of Association (Depedence) : *ggbarstats()* methods**

The Maths scores is binned into a 4-class variable by using [*cut()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/cut).

```{r}
exam1 <- exam_data %>% 
  mutate(MATHS_bins = 
           cut(MATHS, 
               breaks = c(0,60,75,85,100))
)
```

[*ggbarstats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbarstats.html) is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Association.

```{r}
ggbarstats(exam1, 
           x = MATHS_bins, 
           y = GENDER,
           palette = "Blues"
           )
```

## 1.10 Visualising Models

In this section, we will learn how to visualise model diagnostic and model parameters by using parameters package.

-   Toyota Corolla case study will be used. The purpose of study is to build a model to discover factors affecting prices of used-cars by taking into consideration a set of explanatory variables.

### 1.10.1

```{r}
pacman::p_load(readxl, performance, parameters, see)
```

```{r}
car_resale <- read_xls("data/ToyotaCorolla.xls", 
                       "data")
car_resale
```

## 1.11 Multiple Regression Model using lm()

The code chunk below is used to calibrate a multiple linear regression model by using *lm()* of Base Stats of R.

```{r}
model <- lm(Price ~ Age_08_04 + Mfg_Year + KM + 
              Weight + Guarantee_Period, data = car_resale)
model
```

## 1.12 Checking for multicoinearity

[*check_collinearity()*](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/check_collinearity.html) of [**performance**](https://easystats.github.io/performance/) package is used to check for multi correlation.

```{r}
check_collinearity(model)
```

```{r}
check_c <- check_collinearity(model)

plot(check_c)
```

## 1.13 Checking Normality Assumption

We will use [*check_normality()*](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/check_normality.html) of [**performance**](https://easystats.github.io/performance/) package.

```{r}
model1 <- lm(Price ~ Age_08_04 + KM + 
              Weight + Guarantee_Period, data = car_resale)

check_n <- check_normality(model1)

plot(check_n)
```

## 1.14 Checking for Homogeneity of Variances

```{r}
ggcoefstats(model1, 
            output = "plot")
```

# 2. Visualising Uncertainty 

Visualising uncertainty is relatively new in statistical graphics. In this chapter, you will gain hands-on experience on creating statistical graphics for visualising uncertainty. By the end of this chapter you will be able:

-   to plot statistics error bars by using ggplot2,

-   to plot interactive error bars by combining ggplot2, plotly and DT,

-   to create advanced by using ggdist, and

-   to create hypothetical outcome plots (HOPs) by using ungeviz package.

## 2.1 Getting Started

For the purpose of this exercise, the following R packages will be used, they are:

-   tidyverse, a family of R packages for data science process,

-   plotly for creating interactive plot,

-   gganimate for creating animation plot,

-   DT for displaying interactive html table,

-   crosstalk for for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering), and

-   ggdist for visualising distribution and uncertainty.

```{r}
devtools::install_github("wilkelab/ungeviz")
```

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ungeviz, plotly, crosstalk,
               DT, ggdist, ggridges,
               colorspace, gganimate, tidyverse)
```

We will be utilising the exam_data for this exercise.

## 2.2 **Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggplot2 methods**

A point estimate is a single number, such as a mean. Uncertainty, on the other hand, is expressed as standard error, confidence interval, or credible interval. Note: Don’t confuse the uncertainty of a point estimate with the variation in the sample.

::: callout-note
In this section, you will learn how to plot error bars of maths scores by race by using data provided in *exam* tibble data frame.
:::

Firstly, code chunk below will be used to derive the necessary summary statistics.

```{r}
my_sum <- exam_data %>%
  group_by(RACE) %>%
  summarise(
    n=n(),
    mean=mean(MATHS),
    sd=sd(MATHS)
    ) %>%
  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n-1))
```

::: callout-note
-   `group_by()` of **dplyr** package is used to group the observation by RACE,

-   `summarise()` is used to compute the count of observations, mean, standard deviation

-   `mutate()` is used to derive standard error of Maths by RACE, and

-   the output is save as a tibble data table called *my_sum*.
:::

Next, the code chunk below will be used to display *my_sum* tibble data frame in an html table format.

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(my_sum), format = 'html')
```

### 2.2.1 Plotting Standard Error Bars of Point Estimates 

Now we are ready to plot the standard error bars of mean maths score by race as shown below.

```{r}
ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(x=RACE, 
        ymin=mean-se, 
        ymax=mean+se), 
    width=0.2, 
    colour="black", 
    alpha=0.9, 
    size=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes
           (x=RACE, 
            y=mean), 
           stat="identity", 
           color="red",
           size = 1.5,
           alpha=1) +
  ggtitle("Standard error of mean maths score by race")
```

### 2.2.2 Plotting Confidence Interval of Point Estimates 

```{r}
ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(x=reorder(RACE, -mean), 
        ymin=mean-1.96*se, 
        ymax=mean+1.96*se), 
    width=0.2, 
    colour="black", 
    alpha=0.9, 
    size=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes
           (x=RACE, 
            y=mean), 
           stat="identity", 
           color="red",
           size = 1.5,
           alpha=1) +
  labs(x = "Maths score",
       title = "95% confidence interval of mean maths score by race")
```

::: callout-note
-   The confidence intervals are computed by using the formula mean+/-1.96\*se.

-   The error bars is sorted by using the average maths scores.

-   `labs()` argument of ggplot2 is used to change the x-axis label.
:::

### 2.2.3 **Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates with interactive error bars**

```{r}
shared_df = SharedData$new(my_sum)

bscols(widths = c(4,8),
       ggplotly((ggplot(shared_df) +
                   geom_errorbar(aes(
                     x=reorder(RACE, -mean),
                     ymin=mean-2.58*se, 
                     ymax=mean+2.58*se), 
                     width=0.2, 
                     colour="black", 
                     alpha=0.9, 
                     size=0.5) +
                   geom_point(aes(
                     x=RACE, 
                     y=mean, 
                     text = paste("Race:", `RACE`, 
                                  "<br>N:", `n`,
                                  "<br>Avg. Scores:", round(mean, digits = 2),
                                  "<br>95% CI:[", 
                                  round((mean-2.58*se), digits = 2), ",",
                                  round((mean+2.58*se), digits = 2),"]")),
                     stat="identity", 
                     color="red", 
                     size = 1.5, 
                     alpha=1) + 
                   xlab("Race") + 
                   ylab("Average Scores") + 
                   theme_minimal() + 
                   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(
                     angle = 45, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
                   ggtitle("99% Confidence interval of average /<br>maths scores by race")), 
                tooltip = "text"), 
       DT::datatable(shared_df, 
                     rownames = FALSE, 
                     class="compact", 
                     width="100%", 
                     options = list(pageLength = 10,
                                    scrollX=T), 
                     colnames = c("No. of pupils", 
                                  "Avg Scores",
                                  "Std Dev",
                                  "Std Error")) %>%
         formatRound(columns=c('mean', 'sd', 'se'),
                     digits=2))
```

## 2.3 **Visualising Uncertainty: ggdist package**

-   [**ggdist**](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/) is an R package that provides a flexible set of ggplot2 geoms and stats designed especially for visualising distributions and uncertainty.

-   It is designed for both frequentist and Bayesian uncertainty visualization, taking the view that uncertainty visualization can be unified through the perspective of distribution visualization:

    -   for frequentist models, one visualises confidence distributions or bootstrap distributions (see vignette(“freq-uncertainty-vis”));

    -   for Bayesian models, one visualises probability distributions (see the tidybayes package, which builds on top of ggdist).

### 2.3.1 **Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggdist methods**

```{r}
exam_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, 
             y = MATHS)) +
  stat_pointinterval() +
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

For example, in the code chunk below the following arguments are used:

-   .width = 0.95

-   .point = median

-   .interval = qi

```{r}
exam_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, y = MATHS)) +
  stat_pointinterval(.width = 0.95,
  .point = median,
  .interval = qi) +
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of median math score",
    subtitle = "Median Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

Makeover the plot on previous slide by showing 95% and 99% confidence intervals.

```{r}
exam_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, 
             y = MATHS)) +
  stat_pointinterval(
    show.legend = FALSE) +   
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

### 2.3.2 Using stat_gradientinterval() of ggdist 

In the code chunk below, [`stat_gradientinterval()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_gradientinterval.html) of **ggdist** is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.

```{r}
exam_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, 
             y = MATHS)) +
  stat_gradientinterval(   
    fill = "skyblue",      
    show.legend = TRUE     
  ) +                        
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Gradient + interval plot")
```

## 2.4 **Visualising Uncertainty with Hypothetical Outcome Plots (HOPs)**

```{r}
library(ungeviz)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, 
       (aes(x = factor(RACE), y = MATHS))) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(
    height = 0.3, width = 0.05), 
    size = 0.4, color = "#0072B2", alpha = 1/2) +
  geom_hpline(data = sampler(25, group = RACE), height = 0.6, color = "#D55E00") +
  theme_bw() + 
  # `.draw` is a generated column indicating the sample draw
  transition_states(.draw, 1, 3)
```

# 3 **Funnel Plots for Fair Comparisons**

Funnel plot is a specially designed data visualisation for conducting unbiased comparison between outlets, stores or business entities. By the end of this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on:

-   plotting funnel plots by using **funnelPlotR** package,

-   plotting static funnel plot by using ggplot2 package, and

-   plotting interactive funnel plot by using both **plotly R** and **ggplot2** packages.

## 3.1 Getting Started 

In this exercise, four R packages will be used. They are:

-   **readr** for importing csv into R.

-   **FunnelPlotR** for creating funnel plot.

-   **ggplot2** for creating funnel plot manually.

-   **knitr** for building static html table.

-   **plotly** for creating interactive funnel plot.In this exercise, four R packages will be used. They are:

    -   **readr** for importing csv into R.

    -   **FunnelPlotR** for creating funnel plot.

    -   **ggplot2** for creating funnel plot manually.

    -   **knitr** for building static html table.

    -   **plotly** for creating interactive funnel plot.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, FunnelPlotR, plotly, knitr)
```

## 3.2 Importing Data

In this section, COVID-19_DKI_Jakarta will be used. The data was downloaded from [Open Data Covid-19 Provinsi DKI Jakarta portal](https://riwayat-file-covid-19-dki-jakarta-jakartagis.hub.arcgis.com/). For this hands-on exercise, we are going to compare the cumulative COVID-19 cases and death by sub-district (i.e. kelurahan) as at 31st July 2021, DKI Jakarta.

The code chunk below imports the data into R and save it into a tibble data frame object called *covid19*.

```{r}
covid19 <- read_csv("data/COVID-19_DKI_Jakarta.csv") %>%
  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)
```

## 3.3 FunnelPlotR Methods

[**FunnelPlotR**](https://nhs-r-community.github.io/FunnelPlotR/) package uses ggplot to generate funnel plots. It requires a `numerator` (events of interest), `denominator` (population to be considered) and `group`. The key arguments selected for customisation are:

-   `limit`: plot limits (95 or 99).

-   `label_outliers`: to label outliers (true or false).

-   `Poisson_limits`: to add Poisson limits to the plot.

-   `OD_adjust`: to add overdispersed limits to the plot.

-   `xrange` and `yrange`: to specify the range to display for axes, acts like a zoom function.

-   Other aesthetic components such as graph title, axis labels etc.

### 3.3.1 Basic Plot 

```{r}
funnel_plot(
  covid19,
  numerator = Positive,
  denominator = Death,
  group = `Sub-district`
)
```

Things to learn from the code chunk above.

-   `group` in this function is different from the scatterplot. Here, it defines the level of the points to be plotted i.e. Sub-district, District or City. If Cityc is chosen, there are only six data points.

-   By default, `data_type`argument is “SR”.

-   `limit`: Plot limits, accepted values are: 95 or 99, corresponding to 95% or 99.8% quantiles of the distribution.

## 3.4 **FunnelPlotR methods: Makeover 1**

```{r}
funnel_plot(
  covid19,
  numerator = Positive,
  denominator = Death,
  group = 'Sub-district',
  data_type = "RC",
  x_range = c(0, 150),  #<<
  y_range = c(0, 500)
  )
```

```{r}
funnel_plot(
  covid19,
  numerator = Positive,
  denominator = Death,
  group = `Sub-district`,
  data_type = "RC",   
  x_range = c(0, 150),  #<<
  y_range = c(0, 500),
  label = NA,
  title = "Cumulative COVID-19 Fatality Rate by Cumulative Total Number of COVID-19 Positive Cases", #<<           
  x_label = "Cumulative COVID-19 Positive Cases", #<<
  y_label = "Cumulative Fatality Rate"  #<<
)
```

Things to learn from the code chunk above.

-   `label = NA` argument is to removed the default label outliers feature.

-   `title` argument is used to add plot title.

-   `x_label` and `y_label` arguments are used to add/edit x-axis and y-axis titles.

## 3.5 Using ggplot2 methods 

In this section, you will gain hands-on experience on building funnel plots step-by-step by using ggplot2. It aims to enhance you working experience of ggplot2 to customise speciallised data visualisation like funnel plot.

### 3.5.1 Computing the basic derived fields

To plot the funnel plot from scratch, we need to derive cumulative death rate and standard error of cumulative death rate.

```{r}
df <- covid19 %>%
  mutate(rate = Death / Positive) %>%
  mutate(rate.se = sqrt((rate*(1-rate)) / (Positive))) %>%
  filter(rate > 0)
```

Next, the *fit.mean* is computed by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
fit.mean <- weighted.mean(df$rate, 1/df$rate.se^2)
```

The code chunk below is used to compute the lower and upper limits for 95% confidence interval.

```{r}
number.seq <- seq(1, max(df$Positive), 1)

In the code chunk below, ggplot2 functions are used to plot a static funnel plot.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Positive, y = rate)) +
  geom_point(aes(label=`Sub-district`), 
             alpha=0.4) +
  geom_line(data = dfCI, 
            aes(x = number.seq, 
                y = number.ll95), 
            size = 0.4, 
            colour = "grey40", 
            linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_line(data = dfCI, 
            aes(x = number.seq, 
                y = number.ul95), 
            size = 0.4, 
            colour = "grey40", 
            linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_line(data = dfCI, 
            aes(x = number.seq, 
                y = number.ll999), 
            size = 0.4, 
            colour = "grey40") +
  geom_line(data = dfCI, 
            aes(x = number.seq, 
                y = number.ul999), 
            size = 0.4, 
            colour = "grey40") +
  geom_hline(data = dfCI, 
             aes(yintercept = fit.mean), 
             size = 0.4, 
             colour = "grey40") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,0.05)) +
  annotate("text", x = 1, y = -0.13, label = "95%", size = 3, colour = "grey40") + 
  annotate("text", x = 4.5, y = -0.18, label = "99%", size = 3, colour = "grey40") + 
  ggtitle("Cumulative Fatality Rate by Cumulative Number of COVID-19 Cases") +
  xlab("Cumulative Number of COVID-19 Cases") + 
  ylab("Cumulative Fatality Rate") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12),
        legend.position = c(0.91,0.85), 
        legend.title = element_text(size=7),
        legend.text = element_text(size=7),
        legend.background = element_rect(colour = "grey60", linetype = "dotted"),
        legend.key.height = unit(0.3, "cm"))
p
```

## 3.5 **Interactive Funnel Plot: plotly + ggplot2**

The funnel plot created using ggplot2 functions can be made interactive with `ggplotly()` of **plotly** r package.

```{r}
fp_ggplotly <- ggplotly(p,
  tooltip = c("label", 
              "x", 
              "y"))
fp_ggplotly
```
