# 1. Using Tableau

## 1.1 Using Realis 2023 Data

Prepare the data using Tableau - using the drag and drop function to union the various datasets

May have issues - sometimes adjust the number of rows to overcome the issue of 0 rows.

Tableau can auto detect the postal code and set as zipcode/postcode geographical data.

Drag and drop the postal code into the center:

![There can be unknown postal code - as the SLA records are real -time and some postal codes could have been deleted. Will need to download the postal code and search via Google (they maintain the historical data).](images/clipboard-3434141215.png)

## 1.2 Looking at the median price etc

Include filters to the map:

## 1.3. Chloropleth Maps

Tableau can auto-recognise the planning areas - but may not be 100% correct.

Right click and select Geographical Role -\> Province / State.

# 2. Deploying of Shiny Apps

Install rsconnect package

Sign up account at shinyapps.io

Follow steps to connect the rsconnect to the project.

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(rsconnect)

rsconnect::deployApp('prototype02/')
```

Or click through the Publish button after you run the app in Rstudio.
